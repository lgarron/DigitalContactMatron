# DigitalContactMatron

Most important contac systems (iCloud, GMail) allow you to import contacts from a standard `.vcf` format.
Since I often work with new teams of people, I'd like to be able to generate importable contacts from a spreadsheet â€“ faster, easier, more accurate. That's the purpose of DigitalContactMatron.

## Usage

N/A as of yet.

## The Name

At Mathcamp, systems have a tradition of ending in "-matron". Hence "DigitalContactMatron".
